          Hello, my nameâ€™s Rae WiechensðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a graphic designer learning full
          stack development. I enjoy designing email layouts and web graphics,
          as well as creating print materials such as brochures, stickers,
          catalogs and holiday cards. Iâ€™ve provided my experience as a designer
          and marketer to help companies within the manufacturing and tech
          industries.
          <br /><br />My goal is to use my creative and technical skillset to
          transition into a front-end developer role.

        <p>
          In my freetime, I love drawing and crafting. You can check out some of
          my stickers and other designs on my
          <a href="https://www.raewiechens.com/" target="_blank">website</a> or Etsy shop:
          <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/RaeDoesDoodles" target="_blank">RaeDoesDoodles</a>.
          <br /><br />
          When I'm not designing, I'm spending time with my fiance and two
          rabbits, Bilbo and Serene. I'm a member of the St. Louis Rowing Club,
          and enjoy spending time out in nature.
